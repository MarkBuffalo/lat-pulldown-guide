# Lat Pulldown Guide

This guide explains how you can successfully install a Titan X-3 Lat Pulldown attachment on a rogue monster lite rack. 

You may have noticed that the Titan rack is 42", while most rogue monster lite racks are 43". How do you bridge the gap? 

Fortunately, while titan products aren't always compatible with rogue's due to differing hole sizes, Titan's pulldown attachment crossmembers have a lot of room for different bolt sizes. You still need to make up the 1" difference between the posts. This guide will teach you how to do both.

# Step One: Compatibility

Answer the following questions:

1) Do you have a non-flat foot Rogue Monster Lite rack? If so, continue. If not, this guide is not meant for you. 
2) Is your rack 43" wide? If so, continue. If not, this guide is not meant for you.

# Step Two: Hardware Purchase List

If you have a Rogue Monster Lite rack such as an RML-490, RML-690, proceed with the following purchases:

1) 25x AE flat washers, Zinc plated grade 5 steel, 5/8" - https://www.boltdepot.com/Product-Details.aspx?product=15035 (I bought 50 for spares). I suggest buying 50 because you will need 24 total for both crossmmebers, and you will want some left over.
2) 25x Hex nuts, Zinc plated grade 5 steel, 5/8"-11 - https://www.boltdepot.com/Product-Details.aspx?product=2574
3) 25x Hex bolts, Zinc plated grade 5 steel, 5/8"-11 x 4-1/2". Bag(25) - https://www.boltdepot.com/Product-Details.aspx?product=431
4) 25x Lock washers, Zinc plated steel, 5/8" - https://www.boltdepot.com/Product-Details.aspx?product=3030 (I bought 100 because cheap/for spares)

Before shipping costs, the price of these bolts should be less than $45. If you go through Rogue, you will pay $30 and only get 4 bolts. Bad deal. I paid $48.78 for the extra quantities listed above.

#  Step Three: Choosing a Lat Attachment

Please read this section carefully. Some of y'all have 90" racks, others 110". You will need to decide which one will fit your lifestyle and body best. 

As a comparison, with a 90" rack and at 6'8", I can sit down in a bench and grab the lat pulldown handles IF they aren't racked on the bar. Otherwise, I have to stand up and "sit down" with it. 

## Your options include:

1) 88.5" Tall Lat Tower Attachment: https://www.titan.fitness/racks/rack-accessories/lat-tower-tall-rack-attachment-%E2%80%93-x-2%2C-x-3%2C-and-t-3-series-power-rack-compatible/401036.html
2) 78" Tall - Short Lat Tower Attachment: https://www.titan.fitness/racks/rack-accessories/t-3-series/lat-tower-short-height-rack-attachment-%E2%80%93-x-2%2C-x-3%2C-and-t-3-series-power-rack-compatible/401035.html
3) 78" Tall - Normal Lat Tower Attachment: https://www.titan.fitness/racks/rack-accessories/x-2-series/power-rack-lat-tower-attachment-%7C-x-2-or-t-3-series-compatible/PRLATTWR.html

I have personally only tested the tall one. The second and third options, Short/Normal, seem to be about the same height. Odd. 

Note that crossmembers come with each attachment, so you don't need to buy an extra. However, for `Safety` reasons I suggest buying a Rear Base Stabilizer if you don't have one already. 

# Step Four: Installation

Follow the Lat pulldown instructions that come with the Titan attachment. When you get to the part where you need to mount them, special changes come into play:

- For mounting to the rogue rack, use the hardware listed in `Step Two` instead of Titan's hardware. For everything else, use Titan hardware.

You will want a big washer between the hex bolts and the rack. This protects your rack. Example below:

- You will need to add two washers between each upright on the INSIDE, before it connects the Rogue rack to the Titan crossmembers. An example is in this image (note the position of the lock washers and the nuts as well):

# Step Five: Safety Considerations

The low row attachment has foot pedals that are "sharp." Such that if someone were to fall on them neck-first, they could die easily. Kids are prone to tripping and other foolish, spatially-unaware issues. This is why I suggest not putting up the pads. 

## Here are some alternatives:

1) You put up the pads, but use sharp-edge padding and gorilla tape it on. Go to Amazon.com and type in "sharp edge padding." You can glue and tape these to the pedal edges. I strongly suggest doing this if you have kids.
2) Use one of Rogue's Rear Base Stabilizers and put it on top of the crossmember. You can rest your feet on these easily. 

# Additional Options

If you miss having a leg roller to hold your legs in place during seated pulldowns, the REP Fitness [AB-3000](https://www.repfitness.com/rep-ab3000-fid-adj-bench) is a perfect alternative. 

# Finished Product

Here's what mine looks like:

As you can see, I'm using the AB-3000 to seat myself for seated pulldowns.
